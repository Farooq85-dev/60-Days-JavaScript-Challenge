/* The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation
and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.*/

// There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:

// Global Execution Context (GEC)
// Function Execution Context (FEC)

// Each execution context has two phases

// Creation Phase
// Execution Phase

/* When a function is defined in another function, the inner function has access to the code defined in that of the outer function, and that of its parents. This behavior is called lexical scoping.
However, the outer function does not have access to the code within the inner function.
This concept of scope brings up an associate phenomenon in JavaScript called closures. */
