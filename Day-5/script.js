/* Operator precedence in JavaScript determines the order in which different operators are
evaluated in an expression. Understanding operator precedence is crucial for writing correct and predictable code.*/

const add = 2 + 3 * 4;
console.log(add); //Output will be 14

const add1 = (2 + 3) * 4;
console.log(add); //Output will be 20 due to higher precedence of Parenthesis

const bol = true;

console.log(typeof bol); //To chack data type is boolean
